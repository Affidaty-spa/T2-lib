# Transaction

`Transaction` is a `Signable` subclass and is used to comunicate with TRINCI blockchain network. Nonetheless they're not directly interchangeable as `Transaction` class has a specific format and some redefined methods. Although one could recreate it manually using `Signable`, it is much faster and simpler to use `Transaction` instead.

<br/>

## Creation
```ts
const tx = new T2lib.Transaction();
```

<br/>

## Main structure

Below is an overview of all methods and accessors of the `Transaction` class with their descriptions and some example values.

<br/>

```ts
tx.accountId = 'Qme9QcADwLnBSL...';
```
This is the transaction's target account ID. In other words the account by which the transaction is going to be executed.

<br/>

```ts
tx.nonce = new Uint8Array(/* values */);
tx.nonceHex = 'f39d77a9b0043ee2';
tx.genNonce();
```
This is the transaction's anti-replay value. It is 8 bytes long and can be set as a bytearray, hex string or generated automatically.

<br/>

```ts
tx.networkName = 'skynet';
```
Name of the transaction's target network. A TRINCI network won't accept transactions built for another network. Network name can be set in TRINCI core's settings.

<br/>

```ts
tx.smartContractHash = new Uint8Array(/* values */);
tx.smartContractHashHex = '12208ebac7c5bbf519aba12b58e9e53f69189c827f0bf0f091f54d7bba1dfe303b30';
```
Hash of the smart contract you want to invoke on target account.
> This field is optional and can be used only when you want to associate a smart contract to previously "clean" account. Once target account is initialized with a smart contract, this field is not needed anymore as that smart contract will be executed automatically. An account cannot be initialized with a different smart contract.

<br/>

```ts
tx.smartContractMethod = 'transfer';
```
Method you want to invoke on target's smart contract.

<br/>

```ts
tx.smartContractMethodArgs = {
    from: 'QmZ6LUiEL64P...',
    to: 'QmSiRYNCz8vn...',
    amount: 10,
};
tx.smartContractMethodArgsBytes = new Uint8Array(/* values */);
tx.smartContractMethodArgsHex = 'a604f82355fae3...';
```
Those are arguments specific to the smart contract's method. They can be set in three ways:
- As a plain JS object. It will be automatically serialized using MessagePack library.
- As an array of bytes, if you use your own encoding (e.g. encrypting data before sending them to invoked method).
- Hex string representing abovementioned array of bytes.

<br/>

```ts
tx.signerPublicKey = myAccount.keyPair.publicKey;
```
Public key used to verify transaction's signature. Even if yu can set it manually, it is not necessary, as it will be automatically derived from private key during transaction's signing.

<br/>

```ts
tx.sign(myAccount.keyPair.privateKey).then(/* ... */);
```
This method is used to sign a transaction with your private key. During this procedure a public key is automatically derived from passed private key and appended to the transaction as signerPublicKey.

<br/>

```ts
tx.verify().then(/* ... */);
```
Method used to verify Transactions's signature. It workks just like `Signable.verifySignature()` (You can also use that, as `Transaction` inherits `Signable`'s methods). The only difference is that public key used for verification is automatically picked from the transaction itself.

<br/>

## Import / Export

Transaction's import and export methods are the same you will find in `Signable` class. They behave in the same exact manner and no further explaining is needed.

```ts

// export
tx.toObject().then(/* ... */);
tx.toBytes().then(/* ... */);
tx.toBase58().then(/* ... */);

// import
tx.fromObject().then(/* ... */);
tx.fromBytes().then(/* ... */);
tx.fromBase58().then(/* ... */);
```
